# Autonomous Windblade Sanding 
**As of 12/8/2022**

## 12/8/2022 Branch Purpose 
- To document the performance of the workspace created by my team for a capstone during the ENGR 4200 Autonomous Systems class hosted by Louisiana State University (LSU).
- To differentiate the performance between the robot by the end of the class and what I've done to improve it independently for research thereafter. 
- To differentiate between before and after I knew how to put together a package with dependencies. 

*NOTE*: The code for the workspace has **NOT** been provided (in this branch) because it was quite large and several files from existing repositories were changed during the project's 
development (see *Section: catkin_ws layout and modified repositories*). ***This should not be a problem now since the MAIN branch is now CLEAN***. I.e. it is 
self-contained and no other repositories' code was modified (although specific codependent packages may be necessary to execute the package being developed).

## Why What We Did (and What I Continue to Research) MATTERS!
- Wind blades (and by extension, turbines) and sanded *by hand* during manufacturing. 
  - Meaning, [MANY workers](https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/stories/lm-castellon-wind-turbine-blade-manufacturing#:~:text=workforce%20that's%20doubled.-,Each%20wind%20turbine%20blade%20takes%20two%20days%20and%20100%20employees,fiberglass%20fabric%20and%20balsa%20wood) needed to work a long time to make 1!
  - This leaves room for Health Hazards...
    - Related to [Styrene Exposure](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352573239_Occupational_health_hazards_and_risks_in_the_wind_industry)
    - Related to [Fatigue](https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/psychosocial/fatigue.html)
  - This *bottlenecks* wind turbine production.
- *SOLUTION*
  - Autonomous sanding robots to lighten worker's physical (via sanding )and mental (via finding defects) load.
