# Autonomous Windblade Sanding 
**As of 12/8/2022**

## 12/8/2022 Branch Purpose 
- To document the performance of the workspace created by my team for a capstone during the ENGR 4200 Autonomous Systems class hosted by Louisiana State University (LSU).
- To differentiate the performance between the robot by the end of the class and what I've done to improve it independently for research thereafter. 
- To differentiate between before and after I knew how to put together a package with dependencies. 

*NOTE: The code for the workspace has ***NOT*** been provided because it is quite large and several files from existing repositories were changed during the project's 
development (see Section: catkin_ws layout and modified repositories). However, ***this should not be a problem since the MAIN branch is CLEAN***. I.e. it is 
self-contained and no other repositories' code was modified (although specific codependent packages may be necessary to execute the package being developed).
